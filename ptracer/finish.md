Congratulations... you have officially completed the tutorial! 

You have now learned how to trace all the system calls in your Python code, with the option of filtering to only show certain system calls (which can be helpful if the program is complex), by using Ptracer. 

As you have experienced, Ptracer does not require any other dependencies and it is not very difficult to integrate it into in your program, yet it adds a lot of value and can save you valuable time. It is definitely worth considering adding it to your next Python project, especially if the script uses a lot of system calls.
