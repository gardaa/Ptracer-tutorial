## Learning Outcomes
This executable tutorial aims to show how you can use Ptracer as a library to trace all the system calls in your Python codebase, to be able to find bugs and failures easier, and overall improve the code quality.

## Prerequisites
Some basic Python knowledge is recommended to easier understand and follow the tutorial. In addition, some knowledge of Linux is also recommended to better understand how the OS deals with system calls, which is a central aspect of the tutorial. 

## Overview of Steps
1. Ptracer Architecture
2. Conda installation and creation of Ptracer environment (Optional)
3. Ptracer installation
4. Simple example
5. More advanced example (Filtering)
6. Conclusion

## Motivation
Monitoring is an important part of DevOps, as it ensures good performance and reliability. This is achieved by tracing a code base and its flows, identifying potential bugs and failures to avoid a negative impact on performance and other factors at an early stage.
